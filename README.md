This repository showcases a comprehensive Power BI Dashboard designed 
for State the main business area, predictive project health analysis, 
optimizing retail sales performance, or analyzing marketing campaign efficacy
The core objective was to transform complex, disparate raw data 
into a set of interactive and visually rich insights. 
The final solution allows users to move beyond static 
reporting and utilize dynamic filters to explore Key Performance Indicators (KPIs),
identify critical trends, and support data-driven decision-making in real-time.   

The technical foundation of this project is built on robust data engineering principles. 
I utilized Power Query extensively for data cleansing, shaping, and merging diverse sources
into an optimized data model. Crucially, 
I implemented precise business logic using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
to create complex calculated measures and columns, ensuring the 
derived metrics are accurate and align perfectly with specific business requirements.

The repository includes all necessary components to review the project: the core Power BI file (.pbix) 
and screenshots of the finished product are available.
To explore the dashboard, simply clone the repository,
ensure you have Power BI Desktop installed, and open the .pbix file.
This project effectively demonstrates the capability to design, model, 
and visualize data that directly impacts strategic and operational efficiency.
